# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product such as a website or application. It is one of the first and most critical steps in the design process.
## What Is Wireframing?
A wireframe is a low-fidelity, simplified layout that outlines the structure and functionality of a page without focusing on design elements like colors, fonts, or graphics. It helps designers, developers, and stakeholders agree on the layout and flow before any real design or coding begins.
##Importance in the Design Process
- **Clarifies structure:** Wireframes provide a clear layout and content hierarchy.
- **Facilitates feedback:** Stakeholders can give early input before investing time in design or code.
- **Saves time and cost:** By identifying problems early, it reduces the need for rework later.
- **Improves usability:** Helps plan a logical and user-friendly flow for the user interface (UI).
## Tools Often Used for Wireframing
- Pen & paper
- Figma
- Balsamiq
- Adobe XD
- Sketch
- Wireframing bridges the gap between an idea and a functional design. It lays the foundation for building intuitive, effective user experiences.
